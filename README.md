DCU Anonymous Bridge

The Anonymously United(AU) Bridge will act as an anonymous and untraceable bridge in which one can bridge their coins between 6 different chains ( Binance , Ethereum, Polygon, Cronos, Avalanche, and
Fantom). This means, one can bridge their BNB over to ETH with complete anonymity, the transaction remaining untraceable on the custodial blockchain.

With respect to anonymity, this bridge will allow one to transfer their funds without having their wallets tracked. Be it an influencer, a big project, etc wishing to remain anonymous, keeping the payments they
receive or pay privately without having to go through a Centralised Exchange.

A detailed document explaining the working of the Bridge will be released when the Bridge goes live.
